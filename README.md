E-Commerce Description Classification

This project involves building a text classification model to categorize e-commerce product descriptions into four labels: Household, Books, Electronics, and Clothing & Accessories. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and Modeling using SVM and Random Forest classifiers.
- EDA: Understanding the dataset's structure and distribution.
- Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing text data to create standard tokens.
- Vectorization: Transforming text data into numerical features using TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer.
- Modeling: Training and evaluating classification models (SVM and Random Forest).
